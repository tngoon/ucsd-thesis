\begin{frontmatter}

%% TITLE PAGES
%
%  This command generates the title, copyright, and signature pages.
%
\makefrontmatter

%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
\begin{dedication}
  To my parents. Thank you.
\end{dedication}


% \begin{mydedication} % You are responsible for formatting here.
%   \vspace{1in}
%   \begin{flushleft}
% 	To me.
%   \end{flushleft}
%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{center}
% 	And you.
%   \end{center}
%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}
% 	Which equals us.
%   \end{flushright}
% \end{mydedication}



%% EPIGRAPH
%
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.
%
\begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
  \emph{To know, is to know that you know nothing.\\
  That is the meaning of true knowledge.}\\
  ---Socrates
\end{epigraph}

% \begin{myepigraph} % You position the text yourself.
%   \vfil
%   \begin{center}
%     {\bf Think! It ain't illegal yet.}
%
% 	\emph{---George Clinton}
%   \end{center}
% \end{myepigraph}

%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%
%  While technically optional, you probably have someone to thank.
%  Also, a paragraph acknowledging all coauthors and publishers (if
%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.
