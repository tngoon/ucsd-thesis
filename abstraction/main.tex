Effectively communicating ideas is an important part of creative collaboration, particularly in getting started and generating ideas. One major challenge of collaboration is the pull of concrete details over conceptual concerns as concrete details often stand out more than high-level structure. For example, discussing specific details of a drawing early can pull attention away from assessing whether the drawing's composition works as a whole. This chapter investigates using a strategy called \textit{abstraction blocks}, movable shapes to represent size and position of drawing elements without the need (or ability) to specify concrete details, for collaborative drawing. We hypothesized that structuring abstraction around these blocks enables more flexible exploration and communication. In an observational study of six synchronous small groups ($n=19$) sketching collaboratively, we found that abstraction blocks enabled more iterative and flexible exploration of drawing compositions. Groups using abstraction blocks explored alternative drawing compositions and discussed high-level concepts such as point-of-view and scale compared to sketching alone.
