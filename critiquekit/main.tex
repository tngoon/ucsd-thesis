\chapter{CritiqueKit: Interactive Guidance Techniques for Improving Creative Feedback}
\label{chapter:critiquekit}
\begin{quote}
    Good feedback is critical to creativity and learning, yet rare. Many people do not know how to actually provide effective feedback. In providing feedback novices tend to focus on low-level, superficial details, leading to lower quality feedback. This chapter introduces two interactive techniques for improving feedback in creative work: reusable suggestions and adaptive guidance. These techniques are embodied in the CritiqueKit system to help reviewers give specific, actionable, and justified feedback. Two real-world deployment studies and two controlled experiments with CritiqueKit found that adaptively-presented suggestions improve the quality of feedback from novice reviewers. Reviewers also reported that suggestions and guidance helped them describe their thoughts and reminded them to provide effective feedback.
